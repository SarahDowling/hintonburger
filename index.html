				<p>We pride ourself in our locally-sourced ingredients.  Making quality food starts with quality ingredients, and we know that supporting producers is the best way to support our community.</p>
				<h2>Hintonburger is located in Hintonburg, a village that was incorporated into Ottawa in 1907. </h2>
				<img src="hamburger-alone.svg" alt="Hintonburger's hamburger icon">
				<p>In Hintonburg’s earliest days, the town was part of the Nepean Township and several farms lined the main road. The town took its name from Josheph Hinton, a local who contributed greatly to the community with his securing of a post office and Nepean township hall. At Hintonburger, we’re proud of our community and local history.</p>

				<h2>Hintonburger only uses locally-sourced beef.</h2>
				<img src="hamburger-alone.svg" alt="Hintonburger's hamburger icon">
				<p>We believe in supporting local farms, leading to both better tasting burgers and a better community. Our beef comes from O’Brien Farms, a local supplier only 25 minutes away.</p>
				<p>When everyone supports local, everyone wins. We’re working to make eating local worth it, one head of lettuce at a time.</p>
